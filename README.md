[Poster](https://github.com/ddstats1/markov-lineup-simulator/blob/main/dulaney-snook-osborne.pdf) that was presented at the 2018 Undergraduate Research Composium

We implemented in R the Markov Chain algorithm described in [Joel Sokol's 2004 paper](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/pdf/10.1287/ited.5.1.47) "An Intuitive Markov Chain Lesson From Baseball", scraped historical player stats from Baseball Reference, and built an R Shiny app that let you simulate a game (or season) between two custom lineups.

The simulator began as an undergraduate project under Dr. Jason Osborne. It's evolved since as I've worked to refactor our code and build a new R Shiny app (the old one's no longer running). I'll be posting the code for the algorithm and sharing the R Shiny app sometime in the future! I left that so vague. I'll do it, seriously. I'm serious
